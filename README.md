ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Roadmvn, passionate about offensive cybersecurity, including penetration testing, hacking, and vulnerability assessment.

ğŸŒ± Currently learning network security, malware analysis, and secure coding, while exploring steganography, wireless security, and social engineering.

ğŸ”§ In my free time, I dive into reverse engineering with Cheat Engine and experiment with red team tools like Metasploit and Nmap.

ğŸ’¡ Always eager to collaborate and learn from others in the cybersecurity field. I keep up with the latest trends through research papers and security blogs.

âš¡ Fun fact: I enjoy video game cracking and creating bots.
