👋 Hi, I’m @Roadmvn, passionate about offensive cybersecurity, including penetration testing, hacking, and vulnerability assessment.

🌱 Currently learning network security, malware analysis, and secure coding, while exploring steganography, wireless security, and social engineering.

🔧 In my free time, I dive into reverse engineering with Cheat Engine and experiment with red team tools like Metasploit and Nmap.

💡 Always eager to collaborate and learn from others in the cybersecurity field. I keep up with the latest trends through research papers and security blogs.

⚡ Fun fact: I enjoy video game cracking and creating bots.
